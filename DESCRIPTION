Description: Provides subset methods
    (supporting both atomic and recursive S3 classes)
    that may be more convenient alternatives to the `[` and `[<-` operators,
    whilst maintaining similar performance.
    Some nice properties of these methods include, but are not limited to, the following.
    1) The `[` and `[<-` operators use different rule-sets for different data.frame-like types
    (data.frames, tibbles, data.tables, tibbles, etc.).
    The 'squarebrackets' methods use the same rule-sets for the different data.frame-like types.
    2) Performing dimensional subset operations on an array using `[` and `[<-`,
    requires a-priori knowledge of the number of dimensions the array has.
    The 'squarebrackets' methods work on any arbitrary dimensions without requiring such prior knowledge.
    3) When selecting names with the `[` and `[<-` operators,
    only the first occurrence of the names are selected in case of duplicate names.
    The 'squarebrackets' methods always perform on all names in case of duplicates,
    not just the first.
    4) The `[[` and `[[<-` operators
    allow operating on a recursive subset of a nested list.
    But these only operate on a single recursive subset,
    and are not vectorized for multiple recursive subsets of a nested list at once.
    'squarebrackets' provides a way to reshape a nested list
    into a 2D recursive array of lists,
    thereby allowing vectorized operations on recursive subsets of such a nested list.
    5) The `[<-` operator only supports copy-on-modify semantics for most classes.
    The 'squarebrackets' methods provides explicit pass-by-reference and pass-by-value semantics,
    whilst still respecting things like binding-locks and mutability rules.
