# squarebrackets 0.0.0.9000
* First "real" experimental version of 'squarebrackets' on GitHub.

# squarebrackets 0.0.0.9001
* Placed the `i2_rec()` and `i2_recin()` in its own, separate set of methods: the `lst_` methods.
* Adjusted the documentation and tests in accordance with the above change.
* The `ss_`/`ss2_` methods will now give an error if dimensional sub-set operations are attempted on non-dimensional objects.

# squarebrackets 0.0.0.9002
* Renamed the `i_` and `i2_` methods to `fi_` and `fi2_`, to avoid confusion.
